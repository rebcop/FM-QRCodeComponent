## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. Just because something looks like it's supposed to be centered, a bit offset may be visually more pleasing if there are other components in play. In this case there is the footer in addition to the card.

2. I don't know the difference between "align-content" and "align-items".

3. If you don't have your basics straight, even simple things can through you for a loop.

### Continued development

- play around with "align-content" and "align-items" to got a concrete understanding without referrencing CSS-Tricks.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is a resource I always refer to for flex. It's very easy to follow and quick to find what I need.
